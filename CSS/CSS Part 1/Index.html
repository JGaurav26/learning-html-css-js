    <h1>ANIME</h1>
    <hr>
    <p><a href="hianime.to">Anime</a> (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ[a]; derived from a shortening of English animation) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Precursors</h3>
    <p>Emakimono and shadow plays (kage-e) are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[19] Emakimono was common in the eleventh century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right to left in chronological order, as a moving panorama.[19] Kage-e was popular during the Edo period and originated from the shadow plays of China.[19] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the eighteenth century.[19] The paper play called kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in the street theater until the 1930s.[19] Puppets of the Bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered ancestors of characters of most Japanese animation.[19] Finally, manga were a heavy inspiration for anime. Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.[19]</p>

    <h3>Pioneers</h3>
    <p>Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[20] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is Katsudō Shashin (c. 1907),[21] a private work by an unknown creator.[22] In 1917, the first professional and publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's Namakura Gatana.[23] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake.[24]</p>
